#create floating IP
openstack floating ip create public
# this adds previously created floating IP to server
openstack server add floating ip f6d24d1c-c39d-4bfd-952f-373ee7bea182 86.50.169.145 # need server name and floating IP
# this adds security group called ‘SSH’ to #server
openstack server add security group f6d24d1c-c39d-4bfd-952f-373ee7bea182 SSH

!!! ALSO NEED TO ADD security group Jupyter
#cahnge back permissions of the .pem key
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/cpouta_drugcomb_dl-2.pem
#ssh to created box. No need for password, since we are using a generated key
ssh cirros@86.50.169.227 -i ~/.ssh/cpouta_drugcomb_dl-2.pem
#delete server 
openstack server delete f6d24d1c-c39d-4bfd-952f-373ee7bea182
#delete floating ip
openstack floating ip delete 86.50.169.145





taito shell
https://research.csc.fi/taito-shell-user-guide is an interactive always active linux-server like shell with up to 4 cores and 128 Gb of memory. But memory can be oversubscribed, so if the node runs out of memory then you also run out

man cPouta shell
https://research.csc.fi/pouta-client-usage
delete floating IP (https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/floating-ip.html)
openstack floating ip delete <floating-ip> [<floating-ip> ...]



CSC general file system
https://research.csc.fi/taito-disk-environment
there is access to 2 Tb of storage in HPC archive. The HPC-archive server is used through iRODS commands, and it is not mounted to Taito as a directory. It is directly bound to the CSC user accounts and requires no special application

cPouta storage
https://research.csc.fi/pouta-storage Computing projects, that have access to cPouta cloud resources, can use the Pouta Object Storage service provided by CSC. This data storage service can be used to store and share up to 1 TB of datasets so that the data can be accessed from anywhere: from a virtual machine in cPouta, Sisu and Taito servers, your local computer or a third party web server elsewhere. Y

Persistent volumes
https://research.csc.fi/pouta-persistent-volumes
Q how are they backed up?
as the name says, stay even when cPouta instances are removed. They can be attached to or detached from virtual machines while they are running.

cPouta Object storage
https://research.csc.fi/pouta-object-storage
Object storage is a cloud storage service, where you can store and retrieve data over HTTPS. This is not tied to any individual virtual machines. The data can be made accessible from anywhere, inside and outside cPouta. Like amazon S3
Q: how are the objects backed up? 
A: There are three copies of the data you store in the service
they are accessible as URL, URLs to objects can be in DNS format: https://containername.object.pouta.csc.fi 
they have no subfolders, but “/“ can be used as pseudofolders

interoperability of cPouta
Since the data in object store is available from anywhere, you can access the data from both the CSC clusters and cloud services. This makes the object store a good place to store datasets and intermediate and final results in cases where your workflow requires the use of both Taito and cPouta, for example.

limitations You can only upload or download data to the service. Modifying a dataset will require replacing the whole dataset with an updated version. https://research.csc.fi/csc-guide-object-storage
more detailed info can be found here https://research.csc.fi/pouta-using-object-storage

usecases
store datasets 
store static datsets (like models?) 
eg https://homepage-in-object-storage.object.pouta.csc.fi/index.html
or backups

costs:
some BU are consumed for storage. See https://research.csc.fi/pouta-accounting
but CSC does not charge for object storage network transfers or API calls.

Resource	Cost
Virtual machines	See flavors page
Storage volumes	3,5 BU / TiB hour
Object storage	3,5 BU / TiB hour
Floating IPs	0,2 BU / hour

HEAT
need to install heat client for openstack to be able to spawn stacks on Pouta via command line
pip install python-heatclient
to be able to circumvent
(pouta) zagidull@lm8-945-003:~/Desktop$ openstack stack create -t ~/Desktop/first_HEAT_stack.yml test_stack
openstack: 'stack create -t /Users/zagidull/Desktop/first_HEAT_stack.yml test_stack' is not an openstack command. See 'openstack --help'.

to create a stack do
(pouta) zagidull@lm8-945-003:~/Desktop$ openstack stack create -t ~/Desktop/first_HEAT_stack.yml testing
first_HEAT_stack.yml
heat_template_version: 2016-10-14

description: https://docs.openstack.org/heat/newton/template_guide/basic_resources.html

resources:

  # this create a floating ip 
  floating_ip:
    type: OS::Nova::FloatingIP
    properties:
      pool: public

  # this associates security groups to the port
  instance_port:
    type: OS::Neutron::Port
    properties:
      network: project_2000774
      security_groups:
        - default
        - SSH
        - Jupyter

  # this creates a key-pair

    type: OS::Nova::FloatingIPAssociation
    properties:
      floating_ip: { get_resource: floating_ip }
      server_id: { get_resource: default_instance }

outputs:
  private_key:

    value: { get_attr: [ my_key, private_key ] }
  instance_ip:
    description: network specs
    value: { get_attr: [default_instance, networks] }

this shows the output of the stack (here “testing” is the name)
openstack stack show testing 

shows console output 
openstack console log show 86659125-40f5-43d9-9733-d83c15553c17

deletes a stack (here “testing” is a name)
openstack stack delete testing

shows stack events
openstack stack event list testing

###
to solve the problem of ssh connections. I generated a new keypair with
openstack keypair create HEAT_KEY > ~/.ssh/HEAT_KEY.private
which means i can use public key HEAT_KEY to connect to instances
